# Firmware: Level 0 Implementation

This firmware implements the minimal Level 0 functionality of the [Gameboard UI Protocol](https://github.com/Affelino/gameboard-ui-protocol).

- Detects pick-up and put-down events
- Sends basic move messages to the host
- Receives LED instructions from the host
- Does not validate user input or track game state

(still on it's way... If you get tired of waiting, ping me ;) )
