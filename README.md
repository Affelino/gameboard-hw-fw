# Gameboard HW & Firmware (NoEi project series)

This repository contains hardware designs and firmware implementations for physical chessboards  
that follow the [Gameboard UI Protocol](https://github.com/Affelino/gameboard-ui-protocol).  

The boards are designed to act as user interfaces for digital board games (e.g. chess),  
with support for RGB LED indicators and per-square presence detection.  

Multiple firmware versions may exist to match different levels of functionality,  
as outlined in the protocol documentation (Levels 0, 0.1, 1, etc.).

Hardware schematics are provided in PDF format. KiCad project files and further documentation may be added later.
